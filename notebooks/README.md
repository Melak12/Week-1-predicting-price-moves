## Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA Process

The following steps were performed for each stock dataset as documented in the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory:

### Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset
FNSPID (Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset) is a comprehensive financial dataset designed to enhance stock market predictions by combining quantitative and qualitative data.

The structure of the data is as follows:

- **headline**: Article release headline, the title of the news article, which often includes key financial actions like stocks hitting highs, price target changes, or company earnings.
- **url**: The direct link to the full news article.
- **publisher**: Author/creator of the article.
- **date**: The publication date and time, including timezone information (UTC-4 timezone).
- **stock**: Stock ticker symbol (unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company). For example, AAPL: Apple.

### Major Works in `AAPL_eda.ipynb`, `AMZN_eda.ipynb`, `GOOG_eda.ipynb`, `META_eda.ipynb`, `MSFT_eda.ipynb`, `NVDA_eda.ipynb`, and `TSLA_eda.ipynb`

For each stock dataset, the following standardized workflow was implemented:

- **Data Loading & Inspection:**
  - Loaded historical stock data using a unified utility function for each ticker (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA).
  - Displayed the first few rows, checked the shape, and reported missing values for each dataset.

- **Datetime Handling:**
  - Converted the 'Date' column to datetime format and set it as the DataFrame index for time series analysis.

- **Stock Price Visualization:**
  - Plotted the time series of Close, Open, High, and Low prices.
  - Displayed candlestick charts for each stock using mplfinance.

- **Trend & Distribution Analysis:**
  - Analyzed and printed the frequency of up, down, and no-change trends in stock price movements.
  - Visualized the distribution of closing prices for each stock.

- **Technical Analysis Indicators:**
  - Applied TA-Lib to calculate and add:
    - 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
    - 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) and its signal/histogram
    - Daily returns, rolling volatility, cumulative returns, Bollinger Bands, and ATR
  - These indicators help analyze price trends, momentum, and volatility for further financial analysis.

- **Visualization of Technical Indicators:**
  - Visualized the close price with SMA overlays, RSI, and MACD using matplotlib for a specified date range (e.g., 2022).

### Major Works in `comparison.ipynb`

- **Date Alignment:** Loaded and aligned news and stock price data by date, normalizing timestamps for accurate comparison.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Used TextBlob to quantify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of news headlines, and aggregated daily sentiment scores.
- **Daily Stock Returns:** Computed daily percentage changes in closing prices to represent stock movements.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Merged daily sentiment and stock returns, calculated the correlation coefficient, and visualized the correlation using a heatmap.
- **Visualization:** Plotted daily sentiment and stock returns over time to visually assess their relationship.

## üõ†Ô∏è TA-Lib Installation (Windows - `.venv`)

This project uses **TA-Lib**, a library for technical analysis. Due to its native C dependencies, installation on Windows requires some extra steps.


### ‚úÖ Step 1: Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: (Optional) Register the Environment for Jupyter Notebooks

If you're working with `.ipynb` files:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv --display-name "Python (.venv)"
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3:  Install Project Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### ‚úÖ Step 4: Install TA-Lib Binary for Windows

TA-Lib requires a compiled binary on Windows. Since it's not available as a standard `pip` install from PyPI for Windows, follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate `.whl` (wheel) file for your Python version and system architecture from this unofficial source.

### ‚úÖ Step 5:  Verify the Installation
```bash
import talib
print(talib.__version__)
```
